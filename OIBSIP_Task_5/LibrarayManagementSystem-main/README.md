The main objective of this project is to provide a completely automated Library by digitizing 
each and every functionality. Starting from the book-keeping, issuing of books, fine
generation, advance booking and report generation all will be accomplished under one single
project. The project will be a web-based project with a database server responsible for
maintaining every single detail of the Library. It has a very user-friendly interface that can
easily be operated by any non-technical person.



      There are essentially two modules of this software;



Admin module: Admin will have complete control over the system. Admin has permission to
update, delete or modify any existing record or make a new entry (books and members). 



 Users: Normal users enjoy only limited privileges. They have view access to the books.
They can browse through the categories, search for a particular book, and return and issue a
book. They are also provided with an email option in case of a query.
